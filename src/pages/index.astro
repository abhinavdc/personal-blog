      My Experiments with <span class="line-through">Truth</span> Code
    </h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my blogâ€”a little corner of the web where I share what I'm
      learning, working on, and occasionally figuring out as a developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of this as part technical journal, part thought dump. It's where I
      document the challenges I tackle, the lessons I pick up along the way, and
      the breakthroughs (big or small) that keep me excited about coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're here to pick up a new idea, find a relatable story, or just
      see how someone else approaches development, I hope you leave with
      something useful. Thanks for stopping by!
    </p>
