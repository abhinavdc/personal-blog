      Hey there! I'm <strong>Abhinav Dinesh</strong>, a frontend engineer
      passionate about crafting elegant, efficient, and scalable user
      interfaces. My journey in tech has taken me through startups, SaaS
      platforms, and entrepreneurial ventures, giving me a wide lens on solving
      problems and building impactful software.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm at <strong>Inflection.io</strong>, developing core tools
      for marketing automation and helping teams work smarter. Over the years,
      I've worked with some amazing tech stacks and I'm always exploring new
      frontiers.
    </p>

      This blog is where I document my experiments with code, share what I
      learn, and reflect on my experiences as a developer. It's my space to
      write, tinker, and growâ€”and hopefully inspire others to do the same.
    </p>

      When I'm not immersed in code, you'll find me with headphones on, diving
      into classic rock or indie gems, or flipping through self-help books on my
      Kindle. Or maybe I'm busy researching my next travel destination. I also
      enjoy exploring productivity hacks and using tools like <strong
        >Obsidian</strong
      > and <strong>Dynalist</strong> to stay on top of things.
