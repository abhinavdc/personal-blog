My favorite VS Code extensions that boost my productivity.

Again, in no particular order.

## Better Comments

Once you get used to this extension, coding without it would make your comments seem out of place. Better Comments formats your comments giving it different colors. Like comments starting with TODO will have an orange font. Comments with exclamation mark will have a red font, so on and so forth. These differences although subtle will make a huge impact on how you code. Like I really love the way this extension makes it so easy to identify the todo comments in my code. I no longer miss out todos because they stand out within the code making you more likely to complete the tasks and remove the comment.

## Code Spell Checker

Whether you are writing comments, user facing messages, or even naming a method, it is very embarrassing to get the spelling wrong. Imagine reviewing a PR where a colleague renamed a variable that you had named as _messageRecieved_ to _messageReceived_, not at one or two places but in hundreds of places. I have been in that place and wished VS Code had a spell checker built in like MS Word. That's when I found out (rather digged out) Spell Checker, it's really a lifesaver, especially if you have a blog and you write it with your IDE like I do.

## GitLens

GitLens is like the first thing I install when I do a fresh installation of VS Code. I really don't know what are the features of GitLens , because frankly I haven't used it without it. But trust me, you wouldn't want to without it. Although VSCode has got many features of git built in, GitLens enhances those features and add many on top of it.

## One Monokai Theme

Stumbled upon this theme after I read about it somewhere and have stuck to it. It's a simple no nonsense theme, just the way I like it. Instead of black this has more of a dark purple shade and it looks good. Give it a try.

## change-case

I use ngx-translate in my projects and this extension works like a charm for it's purpose. You can select a text and change it to snake case, camel case, kebab case, all upper, all lower everything you would probably need is available. You can set keyboards shortcuts for this in VSCode, but I was too lazy to configure it myself, so instead found an extension to do the job for me.

## Paste JSON as code

If you have have coded in typescript you would have created interfaces and classes. Creating models from the api contracts is really boring and time consuming. That's when this extension saves the day, just copy the JSON response from the API, press Ctrl + Alt + Shift + V, type in a name and voila you have all the interfaces made for you rom the JSON. Now you really dont have an excuse for _any_ type, sorry.

## TSLint / ESLint

A must have for writing quality code. Very useful if you have many people working on the same project. Also you can add new rules to the lint config and have more control over the code quality. Just do a google search if you have any particular rule to follow, there might already be a rule in tslint and eslint for that, just add that to the config, you are all set to go.
