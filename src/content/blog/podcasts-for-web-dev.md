These are some of the podcasts I listen to, to stay updated on the trends and happenings in the front end and web development scene.

In no particular order.

## [Syntax](https://syntax.fm)

As the hosts call it, Syntax is a Tasty Treats Podcast for Web Developers. They have some really awesome episodes and the quality of the content is awesome. It's fun to listen to and informative at the same time. Hosted by Wes Bos and Scott Tolinski they have some hilarious episodes as well as very content thick ones which you might have to listen to again and again to get all the information.

## [FrontEndHappyHour](https://frontendhappyhour.com)

Hosted by developers from Netflix, Evernote, LinkedIn and Atlassian, this is also one of the most engaging, fun and informative podcasts I found. The panel talks over drinks about all things Front End development. It is so enlightening to hear the panelists take on different subjects. Its like having mentors who work at these tech giants. Lots of good episodes here as well.

## [DeveloperTea](https://spec.fm/podcasts/developer-tea)

Podcasts that can fit inside your tea break. Hosted by Jonathan Cutrell this podcasts takes a different route. This is not a pure tech podcast instead touches on many aspects of software development that are not discussed so much. The host encourages us to see things differently on a wide variety of topics from criticism to levelling up in your career. The amount of tech is less and the amount of help, wisdom and advice is mote in this podcasts. Shouldn't miss this podcasts.
